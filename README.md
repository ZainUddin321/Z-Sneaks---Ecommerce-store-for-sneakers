# Z-Sneaks - Ecommerce-store-for-sneakers

This platform ultimate destination for authentic and rare sneakers from the most sought-after brands in the industry.

This project is built on top of the latest .NET 6 framework, using Angular for the frontend and MongoDB for the database. This powerful combination allows me to create a modern and scalable web application that can handle complex workflows and large amounts of data.

With .NET 6, I got access to the latest features and improvements in the framework, which allows me to create a fast and efficient backend system that can handle requests and data processing with ease. Angular provides a robust and flexible frontend architecture that enables me to create an intuitive and engaging user interface for the users.

I chose MongoDB as the database solution for its scalability and flexibility. It is a NoSQL document-oriented database that can handle large volumes of data, making it an ideal choice for our project. We can store and retrieve data quickly and efficiently, allowing me to provide a seamless user experience.

My this project is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing to add new features and functionality as needed. I believe that this project will provide an excellent user experience, and I am excited to see what the future holds for it.
